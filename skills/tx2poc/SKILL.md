description: Minimal workflow for turning an EVM transaction trace into a factual analysis and Foundry PoC.
---

Use this skill when the user provides an EVM chain and transaction hash and wants a Foundry PoC. Keep the workflow strict, but keep authoring rules minimal.

## Paths

Use the current workspace root as the target repo. `$SKILL_DIR` is the directory containing this `SKILL.md`.
When running shell examples, set `SKILL_DIR` to that absolute path or substitute the absolute path directly.

Skill-owned paths are under `$SKILL_DIR`: `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`, `data/`.
Workspace-owned paths are under the target repo root: `cases/`, `lib/`, generated artifacts, and Foundry config.

- `$CASE_DIR`: direct child of `cases/`.
- `$POC_FILE`: `$CASE_DIR/<poc_name>_exp.sol`.
- `$EVIDENCE_DIR`: `$CASE_DIR/evidence`.

If identity is unknown, start with a provisional folder. After role decision, rename to `yyyy-mm-<poc_name>-<txprefix>`. Keep user-facing files in `$CASE_DIR`; keep script-owned factual artifacts and logs in `$EVIDENCE_DIR`.

## Workspace Setup

Requires Foundry/Forge, git/network access when `forge-std` is missing, `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` for trace fetching, and `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` for source/ABI lookup.

Before fetching traces:

- Run `python "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/setup_workspace.py"` from the workspace root.
- This creates `cases/`, copies missing helper files, writes missing `foundry.toml`/`remappings.txt` from bundled assets, and installs missing `forge-std`.
- Do not reinstall or overwrite existing helpers/config when they already exist.

## Workflow

Scripts write factual artifacts only. Codex writes roles, analysis, and Solidity.

1. Check fetch environment.

   Confirm the chain alias, RPC/key availability, and whether trace fetching can run.

   ```bash
   python "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/check_env.py" --chain <chain> --fetch
   ```

   Stop if required fetch access is missing.

2. Build factual trace artifacts.

   Fetch or reuse the transaction trace. `trace_tx.py` takes the case folder as `--output-dir` and writes script-owned factual files under `$EVIDENCE_DIR`.

   ```bash
   python "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/trace_tx.py" --chain <chain> --tx <txhash> --output-dir $CASE_DIR
   ```

   Expected output: `$EVIDENCE_DIR/tx.json`, `$EVIDENCE_DIR/receipt.json`, `$EVIDENCE_DIR/block.json`, `$EVIDENCE_DIR/trace.raw.json`, `$EVIDENCE_DIR/trace.summary.txt`, and `$EVIDENCE_DIR/tx_context.json`.

3. Fill evidence gaps only when needed.

   Decode important unknown calldata, or check metadata access before selective source/ABI/token queries.

   ```bash
   python "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/decode_calldata.py" <0x_calldata>
   python "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/check_env.py" --chain <chain> --metadata
   ```

   Use Etherscan/source/ABI/token metadata selectively for important undecoded contracts, proxy checks, tokens, or protocol behavior. Do not query just to add names.

   Useful selective evidence examples:

   - Unknown selector on a key exploit call: check 4byte, decode calldata, or query ABI/source.
   - Token role is unclear: query `symbol()`, `name()`, or `decimals()`.
   - Trace shows `DELEGATECALL A -> B` and header/source link depends on it: check explorer proxy metadata or common proxy slots/functions.
   - Helper behavior affects control flow: inspect verified source/ABI.

   See `$SKILL_DIR/references/evidence_commands.md` for command examples.

4. Decide exploit roles.

   Use `$EVIDENCE_DIR/tx_context.json`, `$EVIDENCE_DIR/trace.summary.txt`, calldata, and selective evidence to identify attacker, root/coordinator contract, attack receiver/helper contracts, vulnerable contract, victim, fork block, final profit asset/receiver, and PoC name. Inspect `delegatecall_pairs` for entry/state versus code-target roles, inspect `call_evidence` for important helper scopes, and trace the final profit transfer path before writing the PoC.

   Expected output: `metadata.json`.

5. Check state-sensitive attacker addresses when needed.

   Before writing the PoC, probe pre-attack state only when trace/source suggests attacker address state affects behavior: self-call, attacker `DELEGATECALL`, EIP-7702-like execution, or `msg.sender`-keyed balances, credits, locks, debts, or allowances.

   ```bash
   python "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/state_probe.py" --chain <chain> --block <fork_block> --address <address> --token <token>
   ```

   Candidate addresses include tx sender, tx target/root attack contract, profit receiver, delegatecall caller/code target, and helper contracts that already existed before the tx. Choose relevant tokens and simple address-keyed `uint view(address)` probes from the trace/source. Use protocol-specific `cast call` for other state. Use results to decide normal local helpers vs historical-address execution such as `vm.etch`.

6. Author the analysis and PoC.

   Explain the exploit path in `attack_analysis.md`, then create `$POC_FILE` from `$SKILL_DIR/references/poc_template.sol`.

   Write the Solidity in three passes:

   - Structure pass: set imports, main test contract, helper contracts, function names, callbacks, fork, labels, ordered key calls, and final profit forwarding. Preserve trace call order and observed read sources here.
   - Detail pass: fill typed calls, parameters, derived amounts, callback data, funding, repayment, and assertions. Derive values from the same-scope args, call outputs, balances, reserves, or state reads seen in the trace when available.
   - Polish pass: add short `step N:` comments, remove temporary scaffolding, check naming/style, and ensure no placeholders remain.

   Expected output: `attack_analysis.md` and `$POC_FILE`.

7. Verify the generated PoC.

   Run Forge, inspect failures, and update the PoC until the intended exploit test passes or a blocker is clear.

   ```bash
   forge test --match-path $POC_FILE -vv
   ```

   After the final passing run, capture the user-facing run log with `-vv`, not `-vvvv`.

   ```bash
   forge test --match-path $POC_FILE -vv > $EVIDENCE_DIR/poc_run.log 2>&1
   ```

8. Review and iterate quality.

   Read `$SKILL_DIR/references/good_poc_rules.md`. When subagents are available, ask one subagent to review `metadata.json`, `attack_analysis.md`, `$POC_FILE`, and factual trace artifacts against those rules. The review must explicitly flag magic numbers, especially hardcoded trace-exact irregular amounts. A fixable magic number is `needs work`, not `pass`; derive it or document why derivation is unreliable. Apply concrete fixes and rerun Forge. Repeat for at most 3 review/fix rounds.

   If the PoC is still weak after 3 rounds, stop and tell the user which evidence, behavior, or quality rule still does not work.

   Write `$EVIDENCE_DIR/generation_notes.md` with environment failures, evidence gaps, review rounds, fixes tried, remaining PoC flaws, and what to mention when returning the PoC.

   Write user-facing `final_review.md` with a concise attack summary, the final Forge command/result from `$EVIDENCE_DIR/poc_run.log`, the final good-poc-rules verdict, remaining weaknesses, and reviewer feedback. When the review points out a PoC problem, include the file path, line number, and a small code snippet.

No `attack_plan.md` or other intermediate planning artifact.

## Outputs

Script-owned factual files:

- `evidence/tx.json`, `evidence/receipt.json`, `evidence/block.json`, `evidence/trace.raw.json`
- `evidence/trace.summary.txt`
- `evidence/tx_context.json`

User-facing AI-owned files:

- `metadata.json`
- `attack_analysis.md`
- `<poc_name>_exp.sol`
- `final_review.md`

Non-user-facing AI-owned files:

- `evidence/generation_notes.md`
- `evidence/poc_run.log`

`evidence/tx_context.json` is evidence, not final truth.

## Role Decision

Write `metadata.json` after deciding:

- `attacker`: tx sender or final profit receiver.
- `attack_contract`: attacker-controlled contract driving the call track.
- `vulnerable_contract`: real vulnerable implementation/source address when a proxy is confirmed; otherwise the protocol address whose behavior is exploited.
- `victim`: fund-losing account/entity only when distinct and trace-supported.
- `block_miner`: `block.json.miner` / block beneficiary when present.

Do not mark routers, pairs, proxies, or public executors as vulnerable only because calls pass through them. If no distinct victim exists, set victim to the vulnerable contract. In proxy/state-escrow cases, the victim or asset-holder can be the entry/state proxy even when `vulnerable_contract` is the confirmed implementation/source address.

Choose `vulnerable_contract` as the trace-supported protocol address whose own behavior is the exploited failure point. If the exploited on-chain address is a proxy, use the real implementation/source address for `vulnerable_contract` and record the proxy/entry address separately in metadata or analysis.

Do not pick a contract only because it is noisy, central, or repeatedly used for checks.

If the trace shows an exploited protocol address delegatecalling another address, inspect `tx_context.json.delegatecall_pairs` and record both when useful:

- entry/state address: the address called by the attacker or protocol flow.
- code target: the delegatecall target that supplies executed code.

For multi-contract protocols, record separate roles when useful: exploited entry/state contract, code target/implementation, risk-check dependency, and asset holder/loss source.

Do not call an address a proxy from delegatecall alone. If proxy identity matters for the PoC header, source link, or interface choice, confirm it with source/explorer metadata, EIP-1967/beacon/admin slots, `implementation()`/`admin()` style functions, or a strong repeated fallback-delegate pattern.

## Format Conventions

- Start from `$SKILL_DIR/references/poc_template.sol`. Always use `../basetest.sol`; import `../interface.sol`, `../StableMath.sol`, or `../tokenhelper.sol` only when used. For common interfaces such as ERC20, WETH, pairs, pools, routers, or Balancer, check `../interface.sol` before writing a local interface.
- Use this Solidity header shape: `@KeyInfo` with `Attacker`, `Attack Contract`, `Vulnerable Contract`, and `Attack Tx`; then `@Info`; then short `@Analysis`. Format `@KeyInfo - Total Lost :` from the real transaction impact, with at most two decimals and a unit.
- Keep social/reference link lines in `@Analysis`; the link value may be empty. Insert one empty comment line before the PoC summary/root-cause comments.
- For proxy/delegatecall-based contracts, use the confirmed implementation/source address for the `Vulnerable Contract` header. Mention the proxy/entry address in analysis, labels, or metadata when it matters to the PoC.
- Put the main test contract that inherits `BaseTestWithBalanceLog` before helper contracts.
- Add short comments for key phases, formatted as `step 1: ...`, `step 2: ...`, etc.
- Do not use leading underscores in authored function names, including private/internal helpers, unless required by an existing interface.
- Preserve official token/protocol casing in `poc_name`, folder names, Solidity contract names, and file names when the name is a short symbol such as `SATX`, `USDC`, `GHO`, or `WETH`. Use lowercase only for generic descriptive names.
- Keep declarations scoped to the contract/helper that uses them. File-scope declarations are for shared addresses and interfaces.
- Keep numeric values near the logic that uses them. Only promote a number to a contract constant when it is reused across phases, names a protocol configuration, or improves a non-obvious formula. Clean setup amounts may stay inline or as local variables.

## PoC Conventions

- Fork at `tx_block - 1`.
- Treat incomplete recon as a blocker. If a core token/protocol/vulnerable contract identity, ABI/source/helper behavior, or address-sensitive behavior cannot be resolved well enough to name roles and write typed calls, stop and report the missing evidence instead of inventing address-prefix names or opaque fallbacks.
- Prefer readable reconstruction over opaque replay:
  - Use typed contract calls with named interfaces, addresses, and local variables.
  - Do not copy transaction input, large raw calldata blobs, or raw helper/orchestrator replay.
  - Build calldata or bytes from readable primitives. For ASCII callback markers, use forms like `bytes("1")`; for protocol-encoded data, use `abi.encode` or `abi.encodePacked` with named values.
  - Derive trace-exact irregular amounts from balances, reserves, allowances, function parameters, or return values. For no-arg helper calls, source changing amounts inside the helper scope from `call_evidence` or local reads. Use fixed trace amounts only when there is no reliable state-derived source.
- Rebuild attacker-controlled execution locally. Do not delegate the core exploit to historical attacker/coordinator/helper contracts.
- In PoC code, call the entry/state address seen in the trace. Use implementation/code-target evidence for interfaces, labels, and source links; do not call the implementation directly unless the trace does.
- Do not force local attacker or attack-contract addresses to match the trace. Use `vm.etch` at a historical address only when source or trace evidence shows exact `address(this)` behavior matters.
- Preserve core economics at a high level: asset provenance, callbacks, phase order, and state-dependent repetition should match the trace when they matter to the exploit.
- A tx trace cannot prove `for` vs `while`. Use `for` when the repeat count is a known fixed procedure. Use `while` when the repeat count should come from changing state: balances, reserves, price, debt, collateral, or output amount.
- Use `deal` only for explicit initial capital or non-core setup. Do not use it to replace protocol-acquired funds.
- Final profit handling should follow the trace's final asset and receiver role. If the trace has a clear final profit receiver, forward profit there and assert that receiver's balance change. Use a local test receiver only when the trace receiver is unclear or intentionally abstracted, and explain why.

Before finalizing, check:

- no placeholders or empty tests.
- no raw transaction input or opaque calldata replay.
- every exploit/profit phase named in `attack_analysis.md` appears in `$POC_FILE`, unless the analysis explicitly says that phase is intentionally omitted and why.
- key vulnerable calls and callbacks are present or the omission is explained.
- profit or state-change assertion passes.
